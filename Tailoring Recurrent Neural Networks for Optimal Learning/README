This code generates all the data and figures presented in the article "Tailoring Recurrent Neural Networks for Optimal Learning".
All the scripts can be run in the commertial software MATLAB. 
It includes six different folders:
1) CorrelationsMemoryLambda 
This folder contains scripts to generate data relating memory of an Echo State Network, the correlations between its neurons and the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix.
The code can be run by launching the script mainLambdaVsCorrelationVsMemory.m
The data generated is plotted in Fig.3
2) findOptimalRho
This folder contains a heuristic to find the fraction of cycles to adapt an ESN to a specific task. 
The code can be run by launching the script findCoeffsRho.m
The result is plotted as a dotted line in all the subplots of Fig. 7
3) lasertimeseriesforecasting
This folder contains all the tests relating to the Laser Intensity time series as well as the raw data. 
The tests for memory of different topologies (Fig 4.b) is launched with the script laserTS_TopologiesTests.m . 
The tests for adapting ESN to a specific frequency (Fig.6b) is launched with the script laserTS_CycleTest.m
A small set of the time series is plotted in Fig. 3. The power spectral density is plotted in Fig. 6 b, e, h
TO DO
4) mackeyglasstimeseriesforecasting
This folder contains all the tests relating to the Mackey-Glass time series as well as the generating functions. 
The tests are in the subfolder tests and the generation scripts
The tests for the effects of different network parameters (Fig. 2) is 
The tests for memory of different topologies (Fig 4.a) is launched with the script laserTS_TopologiesTests.m . 
The tests for adapting ESN to a specific frequency (Fig.6b) is launched with the script laserTS_CycleTest.m
A small set of the time series is plotted in Fig. 3. The power spectral density is plotted in Fig. 6 b, e, h
