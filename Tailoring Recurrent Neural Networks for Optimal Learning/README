This code generates all the code relating to the article "Tailoring Recurrent Neural Networks for Optimal Learning".
All the scripts can be run in the commertial software MATLAB. 
It includes six different folders:

1) CorrelationsMemoryLambda 
This folder contains scripts to generate data relating memory of an Echo State Network, the correlations between its neurons and the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix.
The code can be run by launching the script mainLambdaVsCorrelationVsMemory.m
The data generated is plotted in Fig.3

2) findOptimalRho
This folder contains a heuristic to find the fraction of cycles to adapt an ESN to a specific task. 
The code can be run by launching the script findCoeffsRho.m
The result is plotted as a dotted line in all the subplots of Fig. 7

3) lasertimeseriesforecasting
This folder contains all the tests relating to the Laser Intensity time series as well as the raw data. 
The tests for memory of different topologies (Fig 4.b) is launched with the script laserTS_TopologiesTests.m . 
The tests for adapting ESN to a specific frequency (Fig.6b) is launched with the script laserTS_CycleTest.m
A small set of the time series is plotted in Fig. 3. The power spectral density is plotted in Fig. 6 b, e, h

4) mackeyglasstimeseriesforecasting
This folder contains all the tests relating to the Mackey-Glass time series as well as the generating functions. 
The tests are in the subfolder tests and the generation scripts are in the seqGenerators
The tests for the effects of different network parameters (Fig. 2) are launched with the scripts testConnectivityVariousTopologies.m, testDegHetereogeneityVsPerf.m and testPowerLawVariousTopologies.m in the folder networPropertiesVsPerf
The tests for memory of different topologies (Fig 4.a) are launched with the scripts testPowerLawWeightDist.m, testSF.m and testSpecRad.m in the folder ESNPerfVsEigenvalueDistribution. 
The tests for adapting ESN to a specific frequency (Fig.6a) is launched with the script testMGTS_Cycles.m in the folder ESNCyclePerformance.
A small set of the time series is plotted in Fig. 3. The power spectral density is plotted in Fig. 6 a, d, g.

5) spokenarabicdigitrecognition
This folder contains all the tests relating to the calssification of spoken Arabic Digits as well as the preprocessed data. 
The preprocessed data and the preprocessing function are in the folder DataSpokenArabicDigit. The raw data is too large for github, but it can be downloaded from "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spoken+Arabic+Digit".
The tests for memory of different topologies (Fig 4.c) is launched with the script testSpokenDigitRecog_Topologies.m in the folder tests. 
The tests for adapting ESN to a specific frequency (Fig.6b) is launched with the script testSpokenDigitRecog_Cycles.m in the folder tests
The time series for the first digit are plotted in Fig. 3. The power spectral density is plotted in Fig. 6 c, f, i

6) networkCreationFiles
This folder contains the algorithms to generate the different network topologies used in the main text and described in the Methods section.
